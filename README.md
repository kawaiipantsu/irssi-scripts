# My scripts for IRC Irssi client
I remember once a time where you would have loaded up your IRC chat client with all sorts of scripts so you could post what ever info you needed and play around with accepting commands. That time has past but once every so often i find myself in a pickle and need a script to do some automation for me. This is a list over my Irssi scripts that i actually use on a daily basis.

# How to install
Clone all or just the one script you need into your Irssi script folder.
If you need it to autoload, then make a symbolic link under autoload as you would any other.
